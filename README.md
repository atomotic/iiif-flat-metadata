  "Summary (English)": "This 14th century Italian manuscript, probably from Bologna, contains the <i>Digestum Vetus</i>, a fundamental work which attests to the 14th centuryâ€™s interest in the history of Roman law. It comprises various reference texts, which are systematically accompanied by the <i>Glossa ordinaria</i>, the so-called \"Magna glossa\" by Franciscus Accursius, an interlinear gloss and the gloss of the Gloss, which are works of explanation and instruction for the use of the text. Many manicules or fists (lat <i>manicula, ae</i>: small hands) testify to the assiduous labor which a large number of readers have performed on this dry text. This manuscript contains numerous pecia marks. A detached page (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0100/37ar\">f. 37bis</a>) contains a poem to the reader by the Italian jurist Angelus Boncambius (about 1450).",
